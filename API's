As mentioned earlier, an API (Application Programming Interface) is a software program that gives developers access to computing resources and data. APIs adhere to specific rules and methods to clearly communicate requests and responses.

The ability to access data and computing resources greatly increases a developer's efficiency. It is much easier to use an API than to build every single program, method, or dataset from scratch. APIs are built on the principle of abstractionâ€”you don't need to understand the inner workings or complexities of an API to use it in your own environment.

APIs are built with the developer in mind and often times do not offer a graphical user interface (GUI). However, there are exceptions to this standard. Google has released a new tool called APIs Explorer, which allows you to explore various Google APIs interactively
