## Cloud Load Balancing overview
A load balancer distributes user traffic across multiple instances of your applications. By spreading the load, load balancing reduces the risk that your applications experience
performance issues.

By using Cloud Load Balancing, you can serve content as close as possible to your users on a system that can respond to over one million queries per second.

Cloud Load Balancing is a fully distributed, software-defined managed service. It isn't hardware-based, so you don't need to manage a physical load balancing infrastructure.
